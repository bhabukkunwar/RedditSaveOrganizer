* Reddit Save Management
Trying to create website to manage the saved reddit post. 
The post is saved in mongodb with category for proper management of the post.

** Plans
- display based on category 
- drag and drop ui to change the post category and reflect it database

** Usage

*** Configuring Praw (Reddit python interface) 

Praw is a library that interfaces with the Reddit API for you. It limits how many requests you can make, and makes it easy to extract the json responses.

You need to do a bit of setup first though in order for the bot to be able to post to Reddit.

Go to: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

And select Create App

Give it a name. You have to choose a redirect uri (for some stupid reason, stupid because I'm building a bot, not a webapp, but whatever). I chose http://127.0.0.1

You will now get a client_id (red box below) and secret (blue box below). Note it down, but keep it secret.

Now, you need to update your praw ini file to remember these settings. Otherwise, youâ€™ll have to put them in your script and thats dangerous (as others might see them).

This page describes how to change praw.ini files: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html

**** Example `praw.ini`
```
[mysavebot]
client_id: <client_id> 
client_secret: <clien_secret> 
password: <password> 
username: <username> 
```



*** How to run 
  - clone this repo
  - cd in the directory with `docker-compose.yml`
- docker-compose up --build -d
  - `http://0.0.0.0:8081/db/redditsave/` contains all your saved posts and comments in database
  - To stop the docker images
    - docker-compose down
